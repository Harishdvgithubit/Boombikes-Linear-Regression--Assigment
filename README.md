## General Information
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module. 
- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc. 
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions

- The R-squared value of the train set is 77.91% whereas the test set has a value of 74.17% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.

-  The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.

- The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set. 

- Concepts such as EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE were used and model building was done using statsmodels library
